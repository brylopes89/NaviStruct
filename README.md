# NaviStruct

## An Immersive Architectural Experience 

### Project Analysis 

This project provides easy utility for architectural navigation, inspection and modelling. With an architectural model of their choosing, the user is equipped with multiple perspective modes and model assembly/disassembly tools for a controlled and immersive viewing experience.   

### Overview of Mechanics 

The user will have access to 3 perspective modes:  

- **Immersive**: This mode allows the user to navigate inside the architecture using teleportation points.  
- **Dioramic**: This mode allows the user to adjust the scale, rotation, and position of the model from an outside “God” perspective.
- **AR** : Available on mobile, this mode will allow the user to project their models in AR on any physical surface and adjust its size   and rotation.    

The user will also be provided tools that allow the removal/addition of support structures and surfaces (walls, rooftops, floor etc..).

### User Interface 

There will be an accessible menu located on the users left wrist. The menu will provide mode change options, a color selection tool that allows the user to change the color of the model or object in selection, and a removal/add button that stores and adds building structures.  
 
### Control Scheme 

| **Button/ Touch Input (HTC Vive Only)** | **Action it Performs ** | 
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | 
| **Left/Right Triggers (press)** | Model and button selection. |
| **Left/Right Triggers (hold)** | Moves the position of the model or object. |
| **Left Trigger (hold) + Left Trackpad**  | Adjusts the rotation of the model. | 
| **Right Trigger (hold) + Right Trackpad** | Adjusts the scale of the model. | 
| **Grip Button** | Cancels selection, or return to previous menu. | 

### Stretch Goals 

1. Added model textures and selection tool   
3. Intuitive holographic menu display 
4. Music/sfx toggle
